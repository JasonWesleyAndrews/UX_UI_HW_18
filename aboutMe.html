               <p>I’m a Product Designer who has been gaining experience and studying various disciplines in tech since 2019. I have knowledge in every facet of the design process, from problem validation and prototyping, to creating high-fidelity mockups. I recently completed Georgia Tech’s UX/UI Bootcamp, received a certificate in Product Management from General Assembly and became a Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO). <br> <br>
                

I’m passionate about discovering customer needs and delivering UX solutions that address those needs, while creating value for the business. I know how important it is to make data-driven decisions and continue to iterate on designs, because no solution is perfect. <br>
<br>

I have the soft skills to collaborate with engineers, product and other designers. I am capable of conducting UX research, conducting usability testing, and making quick sketches to articulate design decisions on the fly. I am humble, but I have a strong personality and the communication skills to help drive decisions and create alignment within a team. <br>
